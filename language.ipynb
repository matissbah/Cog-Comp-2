        "\n",
        "Infants are exposed to language even before they are born. However, the language infants are exposed to do not contain clear information about its structure, after all what reaches the infants' ears is just one big stream of sounds. In order to learn a language, it is necessary to break down this stream of sounds into its basic structural components: words.\n",
        "\n",
        "Luckily, the infant's brain is smart enough to use what information *is* available: statistical information about transitional probabilities between syllables (and phonemes, and words, etc., but in this assignment we will focus on syllables).\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, the phrase \"pretty baby\" is probably often heard by an infant, but from the sound \"pret ty ba by\" it is not clear what the word boundaries are. After all, \"pret | ty ba by\" seems just as good as a segmentation as \"pret ty ba | by\" and \"pret ty | ba by\" or even \"pret | ty | ba | by\". However, as exposure to language increases, and words are used in different sentences, the infant learns that \"ba\" often follows \"ty\", whereas \"ba ty\" is not often heard. Syllable combinations occur more frequently within words than between words. We call this the *transitional probability*. It is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$P(y|x) = \\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)} = \\frac{\\textrm{freq}(x,y)}{\\textrm{freq}(x)}$\n",
        "\n",
        "where the probability of syllable $y$ following syllable $x$ equals the frequency of $x$ and $y$ co-occurring divided by the frequency of $x$ itself. Now we can use this information on our stream of syllables in our artificial language\n",
